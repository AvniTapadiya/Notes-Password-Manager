## How to Use
- Requirements:
  - C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio)
  - Standard C++ library
- Instructions:
  - Download the project files (main.cpp, User.h, Authenticator.h, NotesManager.h, PasswordManager.h, Report.txt) from GitHub.
  - Open main.cpp in any C++ IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, CLion).
  - Compile and run main.cpp.
  - Upon execution, the program creates an "output" folder in the same directory.
  - All required files (notes.txt, password.txt, user.txt) are automatically generated inside the "output" folder.
  - You can refer to report.txt to understand more about the project components and how it works.
